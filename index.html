        </p>
        <p>
          Ingredients:
        </p>
        <p>
          1 1/2 cups couscous
  2 cups vegetable broth
  2 tablespoons olive oil
  1 onion, finely chopped
  2 cloves garlic, minced
  1 teaspoon ground cumin
  1 teaspoon ground coriander
  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
  1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
  1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
  Salt and pepper to taste
  2 carrots, peeled and sliced
  2 zucchinis, sliced
  1 bell pepper, diced
  1 cup canned chickpeas, drained and rinsed
  1 cup diced tomatoes (fresh or canned)
  1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro or parsley, for garnish
  Lemon wedges, for serving
        </p>
        <p>
          Instructions:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Stir in the ground cumin, ground coriander, ground cinnamon, ground turmeric, ground ginger, salt, and pepper. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the spices are fragrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Add the sliced carrots, zucchinis, diced bell pepper, chickpeas, and diced tomatoes to the pot. Stir well to combine.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Pour in the vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a boil.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. While the vegetables are simmering, prepare the couscous according to the package instructions. Typically, you would bring the vegetable broth to a boil, add the couscous, cover, and let it sit off the heat for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Once the vegetables are tender, taste the stew and adjust seasoning if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. To serve, fluff the couscous with a fork and divide it among serving plates. Ladle the vegetable stew over the couscous.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro or parsley and serve with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the couscous.

          Comorian Chicken Pilao Recipe:
        </p>
        <p>
          Ingredients:
        </p>
        <p>
          2 cups long-grain rice (like Basmati)
          4 chicken thighs, skinless and bone-in
          2 tablespoons vegetable oil
          1 large onion, finely chopped
          2 cloves garlic, minced
          1 teaspoon ground cumin
          1 teaspoon ground coriander
          1 teaspoon ground turmeric
          1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
          1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
          Salt and pepper to taste
          4 cups chicken broth
          1 cup frozen peas
          1/2 cup raisins or currants
          Chopped fresh cilantro or parsley, for garnish
          Lemon wedges, for serving
        </p>
        <p>
          Instructions:
        </p>
        <p>
          1. Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain well and set aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          3. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Push the onion and garlic to one side of the skillet and add the chicken thighs, seasoned with salt and pepper, to the other side. Cook the chicken thighs until browned on both sides, about 5-6 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. To the skillet, add the ground cumin, ground coriander, ground turmeric, ground cinnamon, and ground cloves. Stir well to combine with the onion and garlic, cooking for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Return the chicken thighs to the skillet and add the rinsed rice. Stir everything together to coat the rice with the spices.
        </p>
        <p>
          7. Pour in the chicken broth and bring the mixture to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is almost cooked and most of the liquid is absorbed.
        </p>
        <p>
          8. Stir in the frozen peas and raisins or currants. Cover and continue to simmer for another 5-7 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and the peas are heated through.
        </p>
        <p>
          9. Once done, remove the skillet from heat and let it sit, covered, for a few minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
          10. Fluff the pilao with a fork and serve garnished with chopped fresh cilantro or parsley. Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side.
        </p>

          ENJOY!!!

        <p>
          1 package (16 ounces) filo dough, thawed
          1 1/2 cups mixed nuts (such as walnuts, almonds, and pistachios), finely chopped
          1 cup unsalted butter, melted

        </p>
        <p>
          9. Once baklawa is done baking, pour warm syrup over the top, covering the entire surface.
